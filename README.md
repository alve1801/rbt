Red-black tree implementation

I was reading up on text editors (good ol' vi vs emacs), and decided to try my hands at making my own. That required me to implement [ropes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(data_structure)), which in turn required me to implement [red-black trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree) (well, it didn't, but I'd like the ropes to be *efficient*, so yeah). Here's what I have so far - insertions work, I'm working on deletions, tutorials for those are a nightmare. I'll have to write an article for [my website](https://avethenoul.neocities.org) once I'm done with this mess . . .
